# Project Overview
Welcome to my Amazon Website Clone project! In this project, I recreated the first page of the Amazon website using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to showcase my front-end development skills and demonstrate my ability to create engaging and responsive user interfaces.

# Features
Responsive Design: The clone is designed to adapt and look great on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. I used media queries and flexbox/grid to achieve this seamless responsiveness.

Interactive Elements: I added interactive elements like dropdown menus, search bar functionality, and hover effects on product cards and buttons to enhance the user experience.

Product Carousel: Implemented a product carousel/slider that allows users to view multiple product images in a dynamic and engaging way.

Product Details Page: Each product is linked to a separate page that displays detailed information about the selected item.
